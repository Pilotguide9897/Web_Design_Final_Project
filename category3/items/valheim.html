      <p><strong>- Manigo</strong> "
        This, this is the game to play. I was never too much into survival games, however every aspect of this game
        makes it not feel like you're grinding and wasting your time, everywhere you look is something new with the
        generated terrain, and all so beautiful too. Single Player is amazing, and the fact you can turn your
        singleplayer world into multiplayer and have your friends come along your adventure is awesome too.

        <strong>- Red Gerard </strong> "
        Valheim is a wonderful open-world game for both single player and multiplayer purposes. I personally have not
        played multiplayer enough to have an in-depth review of it, but I can give my input on the single player aspect.
        If you're interested in a building game where you can whack trees, upgrade crafting stations, and explore new
        materials, you could play minecraft. But if you'd like a more immersive experience with different enemies per
        biome and the opportunity to face your fears in small spaces with gruelling atmospheres? You should play
        valheim.

        "The Swedes are at it again.

        First Mojang created Minecraft, which is still a big hit today, and now Iron Gate Studios has created this
        viking-themed, co-op, procedurally-generated survival game. With over 200 hours invested into this game, even
        though it's still in Early Access, and uncommonly polished for an Early Access game, I can confidently say they
        really nailed it with Valhiem.
        It stands out from the other survival games because it takes out those tedious survival systems."

      <h2>Valhiem</h2>
      <h3> Iron Gate Publishing, Released Febuary 2, 2021</h3>
      <p class="secondaryInfo">
        Valheim is an open-world survival game played from a third-person perspective. As fallen Vikings, players must
        craft tools, build shelters and fight enemies to survive. The game uses distinctive low-resolution stylized
        3D graphics, with a combat system inspired by action games. Co-operative gameplay with up to ten people and
        optional PvP gameplay is also supported.

        After creating their Viking character, players can create a world that is procedurally generated from a map
        seed. Each world is split into several biomes, such as meadows, the Black Forest, swamps, mountains, plains,
        oceans, the Mistlands, the Deep North, and the Ashlands. Each biome has its own unique enemies, items, and
        bosses that change how difficult it is to survive there. Valheim operates on an in-game day and night cycle.

        To survive, players must gather natural resources found throughout the world, either through foraging, hunting,
        mining, or farming.hese resources are used to build shelters, make tools and equipment, and forge weapons.
        Players have a health bar (which depletes from enemy attacks or taking large falls), as well as a stamina bar
        that drains as players perform actions like running and attacking.
