          <strong>- Terantu</strong> "10/10. One of my favorites. A masterfully
          crafted metroidvania that offers atmosphere, clean combat, interesting
          lore and worldbuilding, and character progression that constantly make
          the game fun to play. There is so much of the world to uncover and
          explore that I spent hours my first playthrough just sifting through
          the wonders. Whether they be dark and dreary or calm and serence, each
          environment in HK is different and fun to explore. The
          interconnectedness of the world is akin to DS1's first half, and is a
          masterclass in world design."

          <strong>- Jarod arod </strong> " Hollow knights story is very simple
          if a person goes for a quick play through but as the player sets to
          explore secrets they reveal the history of all their characters in
          vast detail bringing a great immersion to the world. Some secrets are
          so well hidden many would never find it without searching it up, but
          usually the harder to find it is the more rewarding amount of
          information it delivers. Many people of the community develop new
          theories every day after tons of searching of game codes and in game
          tablets. "

          <strong> - The KNIGHT </strong>
          "This is easily the best game I have ever played. Amazing story and
          game play. Allows you to play the game in almost any order you want.
          Unlocks new things at a good speed. It may seem boring at first, but
          once you get to the city of tears, that's where the real fun begins.
          The community for this game is great. It's really hard, which may be a
          deal breaker for some, but for me, it makes the game 15 times better.
          You may die several times to one boss, but beating that boss is the
          level of relief that only drugs can give you. "

        <h2>HollowKnight</h2>
        <h3>Team Cherry, Released Febuary 10, 2017</h3>
        <p>
          Hollow Knight is a 2017 Metroidvania video game developed and
          published by independent developer Team Cherry. In the game, the
          player controls the Knight, a nameless insectoid warrior, who explores
          Hallownest, a fallen kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease, known
          as the infection. The game is set in diverse subterranean locations,
          featuring friendly and hostile insectoid characters and numerous
          bosses. Players have the opportunity to unlock new abilities as they
          explore each location, along with pieces of lore and flavour text that
          are spread throughout the kingdom. The concept behind Hollow Knight
          was conceived in 2013 in the Ludum Dare game jam. Team Cherry wanted
          to create a game inspired by older platformers that replicated the
          explorational aspects of its influences. Inspirations for the game
          include Faxanadu, Metroid, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Angel's
          Egg, and Mega Man X. Development was partially funded through a
          Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that raised over A$57,000 by the end
          of 2014. Hollow Knight was well received by critics, with particular
          praise for its music, art style, worldbuilding, atmosphere, combat and
          level of difficulty. By February 2019, the game had sold 2.8 million
          copies. A sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is currently in
          development.
