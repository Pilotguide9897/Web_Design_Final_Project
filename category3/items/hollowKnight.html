        <h2>User reviews</h2>
        <p><strong>- Argunjill</strong> "Cuphead is a brilliantly developed game, with no bugs or glitches found
          throughout the gameplay whatsoever.
          This game is definitely worth to buy. If you're into this quirky, 30's-inspired animation style, and if you're
          up for difficult challenges (which I believe might be a little bit too hard for younger players to complete),
          with a variety of different, colourful levels and with a good and fun storyline, this game is for YOU.."</p>
        <p>
          <strong>- Arin Yeger</strong> "My favourite game ever specially the challenge to get S ranks for every single
          boss and run n gun ! 5/5 for a mere £16 it’s worth every penny for all the work that went into making it - hand
          drawn 1930’s way like the moving matchstick man method , exhausting work for £16 plus great jazz music ? What
          can I say - bucket list game a million % and compared to expensive triple A titles that are broke from the
          release like the recent Redfall it’s a no brainier specially if you like a fair but firm challenge just buy it -
          "

          "I absolutely love this game I once had it on the Xbox but sold for reasons. I'm got this on the Nintendo Switch
          jokingly saying to myself hey the incredibly hard most visually appealing, most wonderful sounding game is now
          playable in the car lol. The only fights I don't like are the planes but hey graphics are too good to mistake it
          for a bad game and playing this game in handheld mode is wonderful. But the best part mechanics wise is the
          controls. "

          Cuphead is a video game developed and published by Studio MDHR. The game follows Cuphead, a small,
          anthropomorphic cup who, in a deal with the Devil after losing a game at the Devil's casino, is sent on a quest
          to repossess the souls of runaway debtors as payment for Cuphead's loss. In the game, up to two players control
          Cuphead and/or his brother Mugman to fight through several levels and boss fights; the game does not have a
          rigid narrative structure. As the game progresses, the protagonist acquires more power and abilities, eventually
          threatening the Devil himself. Players, however, can only equip a limited number of these abilities at a given
          time.
  
          The game's creators, brothers Chad and Jared Moldenhauer, took inspiration from the rubber hose style of the
          golden age of American animation and the surrealist qualities of works of Walt Disney Animation Studios,
          Fleischer Studios, Warner Bros. Cartoons. Play as Cuphead or Mugman (in single player or local co-op) as you
          traverse strange worlds, acquire new weapons, learn powerful super moves, and discover hidden secrets while you
          try to pay your debt back to the devil!
