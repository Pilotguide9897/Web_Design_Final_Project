      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- Terantu</strong> "10/10. One of my favorites. A masterfully crafted metroidvania that offers
        atmosphere, clean combat, interesting lore and worldbuilding, and character progression that constantly make the
        game fun to play.

        There is so much of the world to uncover and explore that I spent hours my first playthrough just sifting
        through the wonders. Whether they be dark and dreary or calm and serence, each environment in HK is different
        and fun to explore. The interconnectedness of the world is akin to DS1's first half, and is a masterclass in
        world design.

        <strong>- Jarod arod </strong> " Hollow knights story is very simple if a person goes for a quick play through
        but as the player sets to explore secrets they reveal the history of all their characters in vast detail
        bringing a great immersion to the world. Some secrets are so well hidden many would never find it without
        searching it up, but usually the harder to find it is the more rewarding amount of information it delivers. Many
        people of the community develop new theories every day after tons of searching of game codes and in game
        tablets.

          - The KNIGHT
        </strong>
        "This is easily the best game I have ever played. Amazing story and game play. Allows you to play the game in
        almost any order you want. Unlocks new things at a good speed. It may seem boring at first, but once you get to
        the city of tears, that's where the real fun begins. The community for this game is great. It's really hard,
        which may be a deal breaker for some, but for me, it makes the game 15 times better. You may die several times
        to one boss, but beating that boss is the level of relief that only drugs can give you. "

      <h2>HollowKnight</h2>
      <h3> Team Cherry, Released Febuary 10, 2017</h3>
      <p>

        Hollow Knight is a 2017 Metroidvania video game developed and published by independent developer Team Cherry. In
        the game, the player controls the Knight, a nameless insectoid warrior, who explores Hallownest, a fallen
        kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease, known as the infection. The game is set in diverse subterranean
        locations, featuring friendly and hostile insectoid characters and numerous bosses. Players have the opportunity
        to unlock new abilities as they explore each location, along with pieces of lore and flavour text that are
        spread throughout the kingdom.

        The concept behind Hollow Knight was conceived in 2013 in the Ludum Dare game jam. Team Cherry wanted to create
        a game inspired by older platformers that replicated the explorational aspects of its influences. Inspirations
        for the game include Faxanadu, Metroid, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Angel's Egg, and Mega Man X.
        Development was partially funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign that raised over A$57,000 by the
        end of 2014. Hollow Knight was well received by critics, with particular praise for its music, art style,
        worldbuilding, atmosphere, combat and level of difficulty. By February 2019, the game had sold 2.8 million
        copies. A sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is currently in development.
