        <p>
          <strong>- BobbyAlto</strong> " I grew up playing Harvest Moon with my
          mom and it is one of my fondest memories. She would always buy me the
          new one for Christmas, and we would play it all day, filling notebooks
          full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry.
          Although Stardew Valley has unmistakable similarities to Harvest Moon,
          it is a masterpiece in it's own right, one that is very dear to my
          heart after all those years playing with my mum."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>- SeriffPolice </strong> " One thing I never realized until I
          finished the game is that you shouldn't rush it. I got everything done
          8 years in game, found all the secrets, got 100% completionist on the
          tracker, found all the secret cutscenes, collected every hats,
          accessories, rings and weapons that are available in the game and have
          completed all endgame content. But when the credit starts rolling, all
          I feel is emptiness and a void that I can no longer fill up. This is a
          wonderful game that's just so inviting and calming to play, whether it
          is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over."

          "This game got me through a really dark place in my life. I lost my
          job, spouse, and home in less than a year. I would chop wood and fish
          when I couldn't find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on
          the couch listening to the background music. I've put thousands of
          hours into Stardew Valley. The little successes I had were the
          catalyst I needed to think maybe I could have little successes again
          in life, too. Highly recommend. Thank you for making this game."

        <h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
        <h3>The Secret Police LTD, Released Febuary, 2016</h3>
        <p>
          Stardew Valley is a farm life simulation game developed by Eric
          "ConcernedApe" Barone. Players take the role of a character who
          inherits their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place
          known as Stardew Valley. The game was released for Windows in February
          2016 before being ported to other platforms. Stardew Valley is
          open-ended, allowing players to grow crops, raise livestock, fish,
          cook, mine, forage, and socialize with the townspeople, including the
          ability to marry and have children. It allows up to four players to
          play online together. Barone developed Stardew Valley by himself over
          four and a half years. He was heavily inspired by the Story of Seasons
          series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of those
          games. He used it as an exercise to improve his own programming and
          game design skills. British studio Chucklefish approached Barone
          midway through development with the offer to publish the game,
          allowing him to focus more on completing it.
