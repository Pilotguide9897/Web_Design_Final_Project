        <p>
          <strong>- Munkeybizz</strong> "7 years in development by 3 developers
          And the result is a game with tons of content, that runs well (Makes
          sense with how it looks) great netcode and not a lot of bugs Hey DICE
          and Battlefield, this is how you do it Also unlike the last
          Battlefield game, this actually has classes and decent destruction lol
          "
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>- Marty Graw</strong> "This game gave the feeling I though
          Battlefield 2042 would give. The open voice chat is amazing. Being
          able to talk to the other team mates is a blast. You are able to see
          what players reported a player for INCLUDING yourself, so you can feel
          good about yourself if someone reported you for "Cheating" or "Racism
          Discrimination". "
        </p>

          <strong> - 4gotten </strong>
          "To the many plethora of Developers/Producers out there. This right
          here, is what we want from video games. Take notes. This game was
          built by a team of 3 people. It is the dream project of several years
          of work. It's not perfect, but it's much better at launch than most
          FPS games. Very playable, very fun, little to no BS. The developers of
          the game have built what you guys couldn't; An FPS that can run on
          just about any hardware you throw at it, run smoothly, and be packed
          with fun. Remember how it felt to hit the weekend, hop in an Xbox/PS
          Party, Squad up with ur friends, Order a pizza maybe and pull
          all-nighter's because you don't have to do anything tomorrow? That's
          the vibe, right here. This is what I was looking for. That game I can
          squad up with friends in and everyone can just kill stuff and have fun
          doing it."

        <h2>Battlebit</h2>
        <h3>SgtOkiDoki, The Liquid Horse, Vilaskis, Released June 13, 2023</h3>
        <p>
          BattleBit Remastered is a massively multiplayer online first-person
          shooter developed by a team of three indie developers—SgtOkiDoki,
          Vilaskis, and TheLiquidHorse—and published by SgtOkiDoki for Microsoft
          Windows exclusively through the Steam distribution platform. Loosely
          set during a conflict between the United States and Russia, BattleBit
          allows up to 254 players to compete in player versus player matches on
          large maps. The game is strongly inspired by the Battlefield series by
          DICE, with similar gameplay mechanics to earlier entries in that
          series such as team-oriented character classes and destructible
          environments. Players are divided into various squads in their team
          and can choose from one of six classes that have unique loadouts to
          fulfill certain roles: Squad Leader, tasked with commanding their
          squad, with the ability to place rally points for their squad to spawn
          at and are planned to be able to use their binoculars to order
          airstrikes; Assault, a basic and all-rounded fighter; Medic, tasked
          with healing and quickly reviving injured teammates; Support, centered
          around suppressive fire, with the ability to deploy ammunition boxes
          for teammates to resupply from; Engineer, centered around military
          engineering and sapping, with access to explosive weapons to destroy
          enemy structuress.
