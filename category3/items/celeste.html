          <strong>- Munkeybizz</strong> "The best platformer I've played and
          probably my favorite game. Game is difficult but it never feels like
          the games fault, passing that one level you were stuck on always feels
          rewarding. A good amount of content including extra levels which test
          your skills to the max. Movement is a major part of the game and it
          feels really smooth moving around the maps in the game (with their
          structure complimenting the move set)."

          <strong>- James mulli</strong> "God this game was hard... I can't say
          which parts either otherwise I may spoil the game... my hand still
          hurts from holding z,x,c. Story was really good though! Celeste's
          character development is actually really great and they do provide a
          great perspective on mental health and how to battle your inner
          demons. As a pianist myself, the piano soundtrack was really good
          although for the most part it was background music. The music
          atmosphere definitely creates a form of suspense especially when you
          draw to the end of every chapter. "

          "Celeste is my favourite game of all time. Broad statement right?
          Well, no. Celeste is a masterpiece in every aspect. The level design
          is genius, constantly doing new and inventive things and pushing the
          physics and mechanics of the game The music is soooooooooo good! Lena
          Raine has crafted something so personal, touching, beautiful and out
          of this world. Words simply do not do it justice The story, while not
          being the main aspect of the game, is still well done."

        <h3>MaddyMakesGames, Released January 28, 2018</h3>
        <p>
          Celeste is a 2018 platform game developed and published by indie
          studio Maddy Makes Games. The player controls Madeline, a young woman
          with anxiety and depression who aims to climb Celeste Mountain. During
          her climb, she encounters several characters, including a
          personification of her self-doubt known as Badeline, who attempts to
          stop her from climbing the mountain.Celeste is a two-dimensional
          platform game. The player controls Madeline, who has the ability to
          run, jump, climb walls for a limited time, jump off walls, and dash in
          mid-air in one of eight directions. Green gems refill her dash ability
          without the need to land on safe ground. Other objects include "dream
          blocks" that transport her from one side to another when dashed into,
          moving blocks that can transfer their momentum to Madeline when jumped
          off of, and bubbles that move when dashed into and platforms that only
          activate after Madeline dashes.
