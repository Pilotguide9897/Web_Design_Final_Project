      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- Chunkymonkey</strong> "okay so, I'm too lazy to learn video editing to link it in a steam review so
        I'll just describe it
        it's that clip from family guy where quagmire comes out of his house after being inside for a week after
        discovering porn and his one arm is super buff, except instead of quagmire its me and instead of porn its
        gunfire reborn and instead of a week its over 2 years"</p>
      <p>
        <strong>- Looner Tron</strong> "Even though I am not into this kind of looter-shooter game, looking into unique
        art-style, cool graphics design and the cartoony animals of the game, I thought that this would be a game for
        some casual fun. What I found playing was it's just the opposite. There is no difficulty level to choose from
        below 'normal'. The difficulty spikes up exponentially as one progresses though the stage-levels. The number of
        enemies coming in hordes in later stages can become very overwhelming. In single player, you get only one chance
        to revive."

        </strong>
        "i've had a blast with this one so far ! got the DLCs as well, added characters are amazing, overall nice
        graphics, mechanics, challenging levels and bosses - and a solid amount of different weapons to choose from \o/
        playing it with a friend adds to the fun, but its also enjoyable solo imo - highly recommended"

          - Pheria
        </strong>
        "
        Summary: It's a run-based looter shooter; You pick a character, go on an Adventure (run), and get what you can
        get before you get got. You will get got pretty early at first, but as you earn essence during runs you will
        unlock permanent bonuses that quickly add up. Each run will still start on the same level, but you will be
        moving through it ever-faster (though now and then it will throw a twist or two at you, and certain enemies will
        thunder pummel you if you get too sloppy)"
