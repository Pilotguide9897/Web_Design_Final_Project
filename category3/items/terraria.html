          <strong>- Trainsurfer</strong> " Honestly, I don't know why Terraria
          has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play,
          tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you
          can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and
          decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom
          and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods
          adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ... "

          <strong>- Randy Beans </strong> " Terraria was my first ever game on
          PC and was the entire reason for me getting one. I had originally
          started playing the game on my Xbox 360, only to later beg my parents
          to buy me a computer so that I could play the 1.2 update. After that,
          I spent hours grinding through the game. It was shortly after my first
          time completing the game during 1.2 that I played the game again with
          friends. Though not a memorable experience in of itself, it did pave
          the way for those friendships to evolve further. "

          "If you are looking to purchase Terraria, the game is a masterpiece in
          both art and function. One could sink in many hours having fun.
          Additionally, Re-Logic are one of the few companies that really care
          for not only their community but also the passion of gaming. While it
          is true that I do not have the most amount of hours poured into this
          game, Terraria sits close to my heart as it is the first game I played
          with a long-lost friend on his X-box 360. Back then I could not afford
          the luxury of gaming consoles so I leached off of his."

        <h2>Terraria</h2>
        <h3>Re-Logic, Released summer, 2011</h3>
        <p>
          Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with gameplay that revolves around
          exploration, building, crafting, combat, survival, and mining,
          playable in both single-player and multiplayer modes. The game has a
          2D sprite tile-based graphical style reminiscent of the 16-bit sprites
          found on the SNES. The game is noted for its classic
          exploration-adventure style of gameplay, similar to games such as the
          Metroid series and Minecraft. The game starts in a procedurally
          generated world, with players starting out with basic tools and a
          non-player character (NPC) guide to get them started and bring their
          attention to aspects of the game and progression. The game's world is
          made up of several layers of tiles that players can interact with and
          modify. Many resources, such as metal ores, can be found while
          exploring caves.
