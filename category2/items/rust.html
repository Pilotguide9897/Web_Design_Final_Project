      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p> <strong>-Dusty Nickles</strong> "Rust is not just a game; it's an immersive, heart-pounding journey that will captivate you
        like no other gaming
        experience. From its stunning visuals to its intense gameplay, Rust pushes the boundaries of what a survival
        game
        can achieve.""
      </p>
      <p><strong>-MR.NarkWhale</strong> "Amazing game, everyone here says its about survival of the fittest with no real end goal, but
        its definitely
        not that. Rust is a game with no end goal and no real reason, there's no rules, no definite way to play, and no
        single path of progression."</p>
      <p><strong> -Elliot Callaway</strong> "This game is extraordinary. The vibrant landscape and survival difficulty adds to the overall impact. The game
        may seem difficult at first, you will have to deal with your hunger and thirst upkeep, your body temperature and
        wellness, as well as the other players, who will kill you will things such as spears, clubs, rocks, firearms,
        explosives, traps, and many other things.'</p>

      <h2>Rust</h2>
      <h3>Facepunch, released on December 11 2013</h3>
      <p>
        Rust is a multiplayer survival video game developed by Facepunch Studios. Rust was first released in early
        access in December 2013 and received its full release in February 2018. Rust is available on Windows and macOS.
        Console versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One developed in conjunction with Double Eleven were released in May
        2021. Rust was initially created as a clone of DayZ, a popular mod for ARMA 2, with crafting elements akin to
        those in Minecraft.

        The objective of Rust is to survive in the wilderness using gathered or stolen materials. Players must
        successfully manage their hunger, thirst, and health, or risk dying. Despite the presence of hostile animals
        such as bears and wolves, the primary threat to the player is other players due to the game being solely
        multiplayer. Combat is accomplished through firearms and various weapons, such as bows. In addition, vehicles
        controlled by non-player characters will occasionally roam, attacking armed players. Rust features crafting,
        though initially limited until the discovery of specific items in the game's open world. <a
