        <strong> - Heavel</strong> "Valorant is one of those Counter Strike type of games but playing a group of preset
        characters with their unique
        abilities. I would say Valorant is pretty solid in terms of gunplay and balanced abilities, the abilities are
        the
        only new aspect of the game which are mostly about defending, distractions and front assault."

        <strong>- Sam Chapmen</strong> "The best FPS game I’ve ever played.
        Not only because it’s got stunning gameplay and characters the community is GREAT it’s so kind and supportive
        where is with literally every other game I’ve played the community and chat is being spammed with Hate, rage,
        abusive text or harassment ETC where this game is so supportive and kind chat the community is fresh and fun."

        <strong>- Apubro Kumar</strong>"Valorant is so distinct compared to other shooter games. The music, the
        interface and the graphics is so clean and the abilities really make it feel less distractive and the game
        really is good when it comes to no cringe. The voice lines are so nice and never get old and the characters
        represent a country which I really enjoy!"

      <h2>Valorant</h2>
      <h3>Riot Games, released June 2 2020</h3>
      <p>
        Valorant was releasedValorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.Players
        play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main
        game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on
        it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires
        charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and
        one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game
        economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is
        responsible for, and any objectives completed.<br><a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/"> Click here to find
