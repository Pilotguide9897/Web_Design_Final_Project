      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- Dic CEO</strong> "I've played video games my entire life and this game is by far the longest I have
        ever
        consistently and continuously played a game. I got Siege soon after it released and haven't put it down since.
        Its one of the most difficult and challenging games I have ever played not only from an FPS perspective, but
        from a mental standpoint as well."</p>
      <p>
        <strong>- Javien stanford</strong> "Best game ever. Everytime i get on my xbox i play this game for hours. it
        awsomely fun with
        friends. I used to always play fortnite but now its R6. It makes me feel like im watching real life action. gun
        options are awsome. They have a varitey of skins and also have hade some fun gamemodes over the time."

        "this game is just such an experience, from the tactical gameplay and unique operators based on real life events
        and actual tactical units like 707th smb or the GIGN. they put time into minute details which is just
        astonishing."

        The game is just AWSOME!!! There can be some funny stuff happening, wether you cluch a 1v4 or a 1v5 with low
        health, or if your in a squad with a friend or two, you simplly tk eachother just by acting stupid, but there
        are some frustrating things too.

      <h2>Rainbow 6 Seige</h2>
      <h3>Ubisoft, Released December 15, 2015</h3>
      <p>
        Rainbow Six Siege is an online tactical shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and
        published by Ubisoft.The game puts  emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Siege is an entry in the Rainbow Six series
        and the successor to Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative.
        After Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, Ubisoft decided to reboot the
        franchise. The team evaluated the core of the Rainbow Six franchise and believed that letting players
        impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic
        siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units and looked at real-life examples of sieges
        such as the Iranian Embassy siege.<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege">Click
