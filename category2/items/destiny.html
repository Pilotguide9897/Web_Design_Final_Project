      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- Ashton Rogers</strong> "Nothing can make me explain in detail how good this game is. It would fill the
        entire page. All I can say is Bungie, you are amazing. This is singlehandedly one of the BEST games ever made.
        This game is as good as the entire master chief collection combined. "</p>

        <strong>- ElephantSoldier</strong> "Love this game because I don't always like playing in groups because I may
        want
        spend hours just jumping around gathering resources. This game has it all though great ranking, looting, pvp,
        and pve systems! Unlike alot of todays new games where your forced to play a certain way because you have to
        play with others, this game allows me to create my own style of play."

        "Destiny 1 and 2 collectively is the best video game I've ever played.

        I played it for the first time on my friend's Xbox630 during the Destiny 1 beta, and would go to his apartment
        after school with chicken nuggets and that white mountain dew flavor and just stay up screwing around in it,
        taking turns on the controller.

        When the game initially released, I played through vanilla D1's story in a single night while on a skype call
        with my best friends who were doing the same."

        before humanity is completely wiped out. Bungie released four expansion packs, furthering the story, and adding
