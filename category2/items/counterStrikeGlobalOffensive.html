      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- Dilllllllon</strong> "I love this game from the day I started playing it. I thought with such a
        good game existing why do people play fortnite, PUBG, overwatch etcand there are so many different game modes.
        And I recommend you to play this game like it or not you will someday come in love with it. It is an old game
        but is legendary till today from 1999 to 2020 it still lives.
        It is so interesting. How many times ever I played a map it looks interesting. It never gets boring. "</p>

        <strong>- DankCarter</strong> "Man. The day I first tried CSGO at a PC cafe, I fell in love. It's why I own
        a PC from MSI of my own today, and why gaming and FPS titles in general became a major part of my life.
        Counter-Strike has one of the largest fanbased communities backing it up, which quickly becomes apparent with a
        quick YouTube or Twitch search.

        If you're only now getting into PC gaming, the first thing you need to do is buy yourself a copy of CSGO,
        whether you're a fan or not. It's just an unspoken rule. "

        "CSGO, a game that holds a special place in my heart. When I first encountered CSGO for the first time at a
        young age(im sad to say it was the roblox version) I instantly fell in love with it. I had played other shooters
        and this one was something different to me. It was fast paced, but balanced."

      <h2>Counter Strike Global Offensive</h2>
      <h3>Valve, Released August 21, 2012</h3>
      <p>
        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve
        and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years,
        Global Offensive was released for OS X, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360 in August 2012, and for Linux in
        2014.

        The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game
        modes. The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to
        stop them, or Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine
        official game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has
        matchmaking support that allows players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted
        servers with custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in late 2018.
