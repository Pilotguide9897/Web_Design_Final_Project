      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- Teebow</strong> "Even 8 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy.

        Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much
        with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players
        across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make
        them money whilst they're at it."</p>
      <p>
        <strong>- John meyer</strong> "There is something for everyone in GTA Online. Whether you want to race cars, fly
        planes, rob banks, or just explore the vast world of Los Santos, there is something to keep you entertained. The
        game is also constantly being updated with new content, including new missions, vehicles, weapons, and
        clothing."

        "It is all you would want in a Grand Theft Auto game. Ammu-Nation Stores, Shops, Fast Cars, Strip Clubs, and an
        array of 3 protagonists, Michael, Franklin and Trevor. The graphics amaze you and make it feel like you are
        really there, the gameplay is amazing, Online or Story Mode. Online emerges you into a whole other world of
        GTA."

      <h2>Grand Theft Auto V</h2>
      <h3>Rockstar Games, Released September 17, 2015</h3>
      <p>
        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games.
        The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot
        and by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both
        during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and
        driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit
        crimes. Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety
        of different cooperative and competitive game modes. Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight
        enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the world. To accommodate the map's size, the
        game introduces vehicle types absent in its predecessor Grand Theft Auto IV, such as fixed-wing aircraft. In
        combat, auto-aim and a cover system may be used as assistance against enemies.[12] Should players take damage,
        their health meter will gradually regenerate to its halfway point. Players respawn at hospitals when their
        health depletes.
