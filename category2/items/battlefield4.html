      <p><strong>- Ava Virgillo</strong> "This is my favorite Battlefield in the entire series. I used to play this with
        my uncles all day and it was so much fun. The game's weapons are really good and there's not many glitches. When
        that new battlefield we shall not name came out I came back to this for some nostalgia and I had such a great
        time. The campaign is so real. The characters and story are very well written and you actually care about then.

        <strong>- Joe Esplo</strong> "I really enjoy battlefield 4 because of the amount of things to do, while I know
        that it might not have as much as some other bf games I enjoy just hoping on and playing a random game mode the
        main problems I would say is it is really difficult to level/get good with jets because everyone else who uses
        jets is already really good and has everything unlocked. I really like just how many guns are in the game and
        all of them feel just a little different than each other making each one uniqe. "

        "This is my all time favotite game its the only game that I never uninstall I own it across several generations
        and even platforms while Ive supported Dice while purchasing everything they put out I do not care for most and
        probably will not be supporting them post 2042. But BF4 is the high point in FPS games every other shooter
        should hold themselves up to this bar. "

        It fun! But I highly recommend you play on a ps4 pro or Xbox one x or even a high end pc, because this game is
        so demanding. I would have given this a 5 if only it was playable on an hd tv setup (1080p 25fps) it was barely
        playable in my experience on a regular Xbox one and hd tv.

      <h2>Battlefield 4</h2>
      <h3>DICE, Released October 29, 2013</h3>
      <p>
        Battlefield 4 is a 2013 first-person shooter video game developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. The
        game was released in October and November for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and
        Xbox One, and is the sequel to 2011's Battlefield 3, taking place six years later during the fictional "War of
        2020".The game's heads-up display (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner
        features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right
        includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players
        in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The
        mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies,
        green for squadmates, and orange for enemies,
