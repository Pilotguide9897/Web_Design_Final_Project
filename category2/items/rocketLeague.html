      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- J.C.</strong> "Rocket League is one of the best video games I have played!! Definitely recommended
        for everyone who likes
        sports and video games!

        Itâ€™s a fantastic free sports video game that does not rely on any in-game ads. The extra purchases are usually
        bought using in-game currency called Credits that do not change in value over time. Family-friendly experience
        is unique, skill-based and wholesome. Player base includes people of all ages and experience, from children to
        adults."</p>

        <strong>- Rick Decomp</strong> "Started this game on the 28th of October, 2016, i am now a solid Grand Champion
        1, this is before the free to play update and never have i been more into a game like Rocket League, due to my
        competitive nature, i get very into games and will rage when things go upside down and have taken month breaks
        every now and then over the years"

        Ayo im a silver and the game is insane. The graphics are beautiful and the fact that its multiplayer and has so
        many game options is the best. A thing i love is trading because you could always meet nice people who give free
        good things. Their also is a variety of items like, Goal explosions, Import cars, tires, decals and you could
        change the sound of your car.

      <h2>Rocket league</h2>
      <h3>Psyonix, Released July 7, 2015</h3>
      <p>
        Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released
        for PlayStation 4 and Windows in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch being released later on.
        In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner
        Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of 2017. Versions for macOS and Linux were
        also released in 2016, but support for their online services were dropped in 2020. The game went free-to-play in
        September 2020.

        Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of
        the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the
        course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and
        online, including cross-platform play between all versions. <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Click here
