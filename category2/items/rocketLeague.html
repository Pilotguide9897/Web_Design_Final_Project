        <strong>- Ian.D</strong> "Started this game on the 28th of October, 2016, i am now a solid Grand
        Champion 1, this is before the free to play update and never have i been more into a game like Rocket League,
        due to my competitive nature, i get very into games and will rage when things go upside down and have taken
        month breaks every now and then over the years, some pluses to look forward to when purchasing Rocket League is
        that there is a battle pass"

        "Rocket League is one of the best video games I have played!! Definitely recommended for everyone who likes
        sports and video games!

        Itâ€™s a fantastic free sports video game that does not rely on any in-game ads. The extra purchases are usually
        bought using in-game currency called Credits that do not change in value over time. Family-friendly experience
        is unique, skill-based and wholesome. Player base includes people of all ages and experience, from children to
        adults."
