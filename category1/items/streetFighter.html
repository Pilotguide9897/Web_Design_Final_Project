        <h2>User reviews</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>- PoppySeed</strong> "For anyone who has read my other
          reviews, I will not contradict myself. Street Fighter II doesn't win a
          Nobel Prize for plot, but it does win the best story for a fighting
          game of the time. It's not super detailed. Major Bison holds a
          tournament for the fighters, they fight. It follows the plot of the
          original Street Fighter. You play as Ryu again (or, you can choose to
          be), and you are fighting other people. Your old opponent, Vega, is
          now in the game, but he is not the final boss."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>- MadlineClyn</strong> "The World Warriors is a fantastic way
          to begin your Street Fighter playthroughs compared to the 1st, it
          improves with a longer window of time to do the motion inputs,
          includes chargeable moves, and multiple characters. (a.e. Guile,
          Zangeif, and Dhalsim) there are multiple iterations of this one game
          including but not limited to; Champion Edition(which aloud you to play
          as the bosses, Turbo: Hyper-Fighting, Super (which added 4 new
          characters, and Super Turbo (which added a secret boss and playable
          character, with an anniversary version called "Hyper Street Fighter
          II: The Anniversary Edition (which allows you to lay as all the
          versions of the characters). "
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> - PatagoniaSummers </strong>
          " It's overall a major improvement over its inferior prequel, and
          improving the controls. 17 unique characters to choose from, as of the
          newest edition, Ultra Street Fighter II. Numerous updates were
          released such as "Champion Edition" (adding four bosses as playable
          characters and improved game balance), "Hyper Fighting" (faster
          gameplay, new special moves for Ryu, E. Honda, Blanka, Ken, Chun-li,
          Zangief, and Dhalsim), and "Super" (adding four new characters - T.
          Hawk, Fei Long, Dee Jay and Cammy, and added more new special moves)."

        <h2>Street Fighter 2</h2>
        <h3>Nintendo, Released august 30, 1987</h3>
        <p class="secondaryInfo">
          Street Fighter II was released in 1991 following an unsuccessful
          attempt to brand the 1989 beat 'em up game Final Fight as the Street
          Fighter sequel. It is one of the earliest arcade games for Capcom's CP
          System hardware and was designed by Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda,
          who also made Final Fight and Forgotten Worlds. Street Fighter II: The
          World Warrior is the first one-on-one fighting game to give players a
          choice from a variety of player characters with different moves,
          allowing for more varied matches. Each player character has a unique
          fighting style with approximately 30 or more moves, including new
          grappling moves and throws, and two or three special attacks. In the
          single-player mode, the player character is pitted sequentially
          against the seven other main characters before confronting the final
          four bosses, exclusively CPU-controlled. As in the original, a second
          player can join anytime for competitive matches (The character was
          originally named "Mike Bison". To avoid a likeness infringement
          lawsuit, Capcom rotated the names of three of the boss characters for
          international versions of the game. The final boss, named Vega in the
          Japanese version, was given the M. Bison name, the talon-wielding
          Spanish warrior, named Balrog in the Japanese version, was renamed
          Vega and the boxer became Balrog. In a 2019 interview, Mike Tyson
          himself was asked about the "Mike Bison" character design, and
          revealed that he was "honored by the impersonation".)
