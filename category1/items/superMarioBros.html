      <h2>User reviews</h2>
      <p><strong>- Kenpyyy</strong> "One of the first side-scrollers/platformers I've ever played. It's hard to believe
        that a game from 1985 is the second best-selling video game ever. This is definitely going in the Hall of Fame
        for video games. It's so cartoony and addictive to play again and again, and I never get tired of playing it."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>- TommyBahama</strong> "It was quite possibly the most important video game ever made. It paved the way
        for the success of one of the most iconic characters in any media and paved the way for the success of ALL
        future video game consoles. It Brought video game consoles back from the dead after the video game crash of
        1983. No words can emphasise how important this one game was for the whole industry. One of the most popular
        games ever made. "

        " This game is ICONIC. Sure, the graphics are blocky. Sure, Mario's overalls aren't blue, but it's still an
        iconic game.

        Not only did Mario save Princess Toadstool on this adventure, he saved the American video game industry after
        the crash that happened 2 years before the game came out. Thanks, Nintendo!

        Story: Basic, but still great. Bowser, King of the Koopa, has used black magic to turn mushroom people ("Toads")
        into the blocks in the sky ("?" Blocks, Brick Blocks, etc.), and to reverse the spell, Bowser has captured
        Princess Toadstool."

      <h2>Super Mario</h2>
      <h3>Nintendo, Released September 13, 1985</h3>
      <p>
        Super Mario (also known as Super Mario Bros.and Mario) is a platform game series created by Nintendo
        starring their mascot, Mario. It is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario
        game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. There are more than 20 games in the series.
        The objective of the game is to progress through levels by defeating enemies, collecting items and solving
        puzzles without dying. Power-up use is integral to the series. The series has installments featuring both two
        and three-dimensional gameplay. In the 2D games, the player character (usually Mario) jumps on platforms and
        enemies while avoiding their attacks and moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D Super Mario game levels
        have single-exit objectives, which must be reached within a time limit and lead to the next sequential level.
        Super Mario Bros. 3 introduced the overworld, a map of nonlinear levels that branches according to the player's
        choice. Super Mario World introduced levels with multiple exits. Players start with a certain number of lives
        and may gain additional lives by picking up green spotted orange 1-up mushrooms hidden in bricks, collecting 100
        coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without
        touching the ground.
