      <p><strong>- DankKitty</strong> "Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most famous video games of all time! The
        characters, the jumping, the power-ups, and the sure thrill of adventure makes this entire series a fun non-stop
        playing time! Below is a brief look how I think the game is!

        Game Play: The game play is very good. There is really basic controls here and is easy to perform. Novice gamers
        should have a good time here!

        Graphics: The graphics are wonderful. The backgrounds are really beautiful!

        Difficulty: The game is easy but as it goes on you''s find out that it will become more difficult!"</p>

        <strong>- OPprime</strong> "Sonic the Hedgehog is one of the most famous video game characters in video game
        history. Well, the famous Hedgehog got his start in this classic game and has been amazing us ever since. As
        Sonic, you journey through many stages and fight off all kinds of robots in order to defeat archenemy, Dr.
        Robotnik. The levels get more challenging as the game progresses. "

        " I will never forget the snowy Xmas of 1992 when I made the upgrade from the trusty old Commodore 64 to the
        Sega Genesis. I got about 1 game per week for the Genesis and tried just about everything. My first ever game
        tho was Sonic the Hedgehog. The gameplay was simple and that's the way I liked it."

      <h2>Sonic The HedgeHog</h2>
      <h3>Nintendo, Released Summer, 1981</h3>
      <p>
        Sonic the Hedgehog[a] is a Japanese video game series and media franchise created by Yuji Naka, Naoto Ohshima,
        and Hirokazu Yasuhara for Sega. The franchise follows Sonic, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog who battles the
        evil Doctor Eggman, a mad scientist. The main Sonic the Hedgehog games are platformers mostly developed by Sonic
        Team; other games, developed by various studios, include spin-offs in the racing, fighting, party and sports
        genres. The franchise also incorporates printed media, animations, feature films, and merchandise.

        Naka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara developed the first Sonic game, released in 1991 for the Sega Genesis, to provide
        Sega with a mascot to compete with Nintendo's Mario. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video
        game companies during the fourth generation of video game consoles in the early 1990s. Sega Technical Institute
        developed the next three Sonic games, plus the spin-off Sonic Spinball (1993). A number of Sonic games were also
        developed for Sega's 8-bit consoles, the Master System and Game Gear. After a hiatus during the unsuccessful
        Saturn era, the first major 3D Sonic game, Sonic Adventure, was released in 1998 for the Dreamcast. Sega exited
        the console market and shifted to third-party development in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, Xbox, and
        PlayStation systems.
