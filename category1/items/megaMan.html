          <strong>- OBunga</strong> "This game is awesome,but Mega Man II is
          better. This game is HARD. Fighting the Yellow Devil was a pain in the
          @#*! I use the pause glitch to beat that boss and the rest of the
          bosses. With that glitch, I managed to beat the game. I also beaten
          Dr.Wily in only 2 or 3 tries. I never got into the Mega Man series
          until I played the VC version of this game. But, now I LOVE the Mega
          Man series."

          <strong>- Jessie Hardwell</strong> "For a game that's so punishingly,
          seriously difficult, and one that also sets you up to fail, 7/10 is a
          very generous score. This, to me, is the most upsetting videogame of
          all time. It takes ages to master the level layouts, yet life's too
          short, y'know? This really does make me consider how utterly futile my
          hobby is. If I were to give it a score, I'd award Mega Man a crying
          emoticon. "

          <strong> - Hulkattack </strong>
          " If you like a stern challenge then this is the game for you. For
          more casual gamers you might want to wait for Mega Man 2 to hit the
          Virtual Console, as it offers a selection between two levels of
          difficulty and it is a little more balanced. As the foundation for the
          whole Mega Man series, however, this is well worth a look and at just
          500 Wii points still fares well even today. "

        <h2>MegaMan</h2>
        <h3>Nintendo, Released December 17, 1987</h3>
        <p class="secondaryInfo">
          Mega Man, known as Rockman[a] in Japan, is a platform game developed
          and published by Capcom in 1987 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
          It was directed by Akira Kitamura, with Nobuyuki Matsushima as lead
          programmer, and is the first game of the Mega Man franchise and the
          original video game series. Mega Man was produced by a small team
          specifically for the home console market, a first for Capcom, which
          previously focused on arcade video games. The game follows the
          struggle of the humanoid robot and player-character Mega Man against
          the mad scientist Dr. Wily and the six "Robot Masters" under his
          control. Mega Man's nonlinear gameplay lets the player choose the
          order in which to complete its initial six stages. Each culminates in
          a boss battle against one of the Robot Masters that awards the
          player-character a unique weapon. Part of the strategy of the game is
          that the player must carefully choose the order in which to tackle the
          stages so that they can earn the weapons that will be most useful for
          future stages.Critics praised Mega Man for its overall design. Mega
          Man established many of the gameplay, story, and graphical conventions
          that would define the ensuing sequels, subseries, and spin-offs in the
          Mega Man franchise. The game has since been re-released in game
          compilations such as Mega Man Legacy Collection, ported to mobile
          phones, and become a part of console emulation services. A remake with
          3D graphics, titled Mega Man Powered Up, was released for the
          PlayStation Portable in 2006.
