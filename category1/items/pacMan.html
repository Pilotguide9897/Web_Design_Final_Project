          <strong>- ProperLad</strong> "The best game in a generation An old
          classic that few remember going to the arcade to play and compete to
          beat each other's high score. The simplicity of the game was always
          getting down the patterns of the game. Having an element of greater
          difficulty would give it a greater challenge."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>- DopeYeti</strong> "If you're longing for the good ol' days
          of storefront arcades, or if you want to introduce your kids to the
          kind of old-school digital entertainment you grew up on, this mobile
          version of PAC-MAN is the way to go. It plays exactly like the
          original, but manages to look better (thanks to 35 years of graphic
          improvements). It's possible that the game might seem repetitive or
          overly simple to today's kids, but the appeal of the ghost-eating
          challenge that made it a hit way back when still stands out. "

          <strong> - Charley Times </strong>
          " The perfect balance of retro and classic of early game days. The
          high pixelated graphics gives a perfect feeling of what classic arcade
          games are about. Getting the highest score possible was always a
          challenge but one I always got. Having more features that would make
          the game challenging such as predictability of the ghosts and changing
          of the elements of the map."

        <h2>PacMan</h2>
        <h3>Nintendo, Released May 22, 1980</h3>
        <p>
          Pac-Man is a Japanese video game franchise developed, published and
          owned by Bandai Namco Entertainment, a video game publisher that was
          previously known as Namco. Entries have been developed by a wide array
          of other video game companies, including Midway Games, Atari and Mass
          Media, Inc., and was created by Toru Iwatani. The eponymous first
          entry was released in arcades in 1980 by Namco, and published by
          Midway Games in North America. Most Pac-Man games are maze chase
          games, but it has also delved into other genres, such as platformers,
          racing, and sports. Several games in the series were released for a
          multitude of home consoles and are included in many Bandai Namco video
          game compilations. Pac-Man is one of the longest-running,
          best-selling, and highest-grossing video game franchises in history,
          and the game has seen regular releases for over 40 years, has sold
          nearly 48 million copies across all of the platforms, and has grossed
          over US$14 billion, most of which has been from the original arcade
          game. The character of Pac-Man is the official mascot of Bandai Namco,
          and is one of the most recognizable video game characters in history.
          The franchise has been seen as important and influential, and is often
          used as a representation for 1980s popular culture and video games as
          a whole.
