          <strong>- PepsiLover</strong> "This the time where Mario has made
          first debut as Jumpman trying to rescue his girlfriend, Pauline/Lady
          (which it was named back then) by the clutches of Donkey Kong. It was
          a success for Nintendo and thanks to the designer, Shigeru Miyamoto,
          it has a sequel called Donkey Kong Jr., and Mario Bros., and it also
          had spawn merchandise, a cereal, magazine that shows a comic a news
          journalist interviewing with Mario and do some wacky things on a
          construction type of thing, and lastly ports/conversions that are well
          faithful to the original well some of it were trying but could not."

          <strong>- cardinalssss</strong> " Difficulties of this game are well
          balanced, but the few puzzles are recognizable just using a guide. At
          least there are a lot of power ups that can help you making more
          damages or increase your defense, also the enemies aren't impossible
          to kill and sometimes they also drop some Heart or rupees "
        </p>

          " Legend of Zelda is not for the light hearted, it can sometimes be
          unfair, frustrating, and confusing. But Legend of Zelda is a classic
          for a reason, and if you give it the time of day to play it, it will
          give you something fun and unique to play over and over again. "

        <h3>Nintendo, Released febuary 26, 1986</h3>
        <p class="secondaryInfo">
          The Legend of Zelda, originally released in Japan as The Hyrule
          Fantasy: Zelda no Densetsu, is an action-adventure game developed and
          published by Nintendo. The first game of The Legend of Zelda series,
          it is set in the fantasy land of Hyrule and centers on an elf-like boy
          named Link, who aims to collect the eight fragments of the Triforce of
          Wisdom in order to rescue Princess Zelda from Ganon. The player
          controls Link from a top-down perspective and navigates throughout the
          overworld and dungeons, collecting weapons, defeating enemies and
          uncovering secrets along the way.The Legend of Zelda incorporates
          elements of action, adventure, and role-playing genres. The player
          controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels
          the overworld, a large outdoor map with various environments. Link
          begins the game equipped only with a small shield, but can enter a
          cave and receive a sword from an old man who advises, "It's dangerous
          to go alone! Take this.Throughout the adventure, Link finds and
          acquires various items that increase his abilities further, including
          Heart Containers which increase his life meter; magic rings which
          decrease the amount of damage Link takes from enemy attacks; and
          stronger swords which allow Link to inflict more damage to enemies.
          These items are mainly found in caves scattered throughout the land.
          Some are easily accessible, while others are hidden beneath obstacles
          such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls. Defeated enemies sometimes drop
          items including hearts, which refill the life meter, and Rupees, the
          in-game currency. Rupees can also be found in hidden treasure caves
          and are used to buy equipment, information, and ability upgrades.
