          <strong>- Docckiteir</strong> "This the time where Mario has made
          first debut as Jumpman trying to rescue his girlfriend, Pauline/Lady
          (which it was named back then) by the clutches of Donkey Kong. It was
          a success for Nintendo and thanks to the designer, Shigeru Miyamoto,
          it has a sequel called Donkey Kong Jr., and Mario Bros., and it also
          had spawn merchandise, a cereal, magazine that shows a comic a news
          journalist interviewing with Mario and do some wacky things on a
          construction type of thing, and lastly ports/conversions that are well
          faithful to the original well some of it were trying but could not."

          <strong>- BOEjackman</strong> " I Once played the NES version back in
          my childhood since lived in London then I Played it on my NES Mini and
          played the hell out of it. Now I'm Playing the Original Arcade Version
          on my Nintendo Switch. It is a fun & Challenging game to play and
          makes me come back for more, If you find the Original Arcade Machine
          at your local bar or arcade you will be lucky to find one and play it.

          " Classic. This Mario or should I say Donkey Kong game made other
          Mario games possible and save the game industry. The Donkey Kong and
          Mario games are more than just games, they are games that are/going to
          be very popular. Donkey Kong is amazing. It's hard, but a VERY
          IMPORTANT thing. Without Donkey Kong, every game in the world would be
          dead and Super Mario Bros wouldn't be invented, without Super Mario
          Bros, there would be no Super Mario World, without super mario world
          there would be no yoshi's island. "

        <h3>Nintendo, Released July 9, 1981</h3>
        <p class="secondaryInfo">
          Donkey Kong is a 1981 arcade video game developed and published by
          Nintendo. As Jumpman, the player runs and jumps on platforms and
          climbs ladders to ascend a construction site and rescue Pauline from a
          giant gorilla named Donkey Kong. It is the first game in the Donkey
          Kong series as well as Mario's first appearance in a video game.
          Donkey Kong is the product of Nintendo's efforts to develop a hit to
          rival Pac-Man (1980) and break into the North American market. Hiroshi
          Yamauchi, Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to
          first-time video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing from
          inspirations including Beauty and the Beast as well as 1930s American
          classics such as Popeye and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario
          and designed the game alongside chief engineer Gunpei Yokoi. They
          broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization,
          including cutscenes to advance the game's plot and integrating
          multiple stages into the gameplay. Donkey Kong succeeded commercially
          and critically in Japan and North America, where it became the
          highest-grossing game of 1981 and 1982. It was ported to the Game &
          Watch, selling 8 million units, while Nintendo licensed the game to
          Coleco, a developer of arcade conversions for home consoles, selling 6
          million cartridges; the game's various ports sold more than 15 million
          units worldwide. Other companies cloned the game and avoided royalties
          altogether.
