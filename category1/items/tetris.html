        <p>
          <strong>- Category88</strong> "I am a long time fan and competitive
          player of Tetris games, and this is by far my favorite version. The
          game has a wide variety of single player modes which range from
          relaxing to insanely challenging, and the Connected multiplayer
          expansion contains the best multiplayer Tetris I've ever experienced.
          There is also Classic Tetris head-to-head, similar to the Classic
          Tetris World Championships!"
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>- Carolyn</strong> "This game is great and I would recommend
          it to anyone. The story mode can be a bit challenging but its such a
          fun and emotional experience to play through the levels with their
          music. Some of the songs almost bring me to tears each time I play
          through them. I would also definitely recommend playing this in VR as
          it just enhances everything so much more and allows you to enter a
          flow with the game."

          " Looking for a teris experience that really gives you a new
          experience, that will give experienced players a run for their money.
          Look no further. Innovative level design, beautiful graphics and
          awesome soundscapes."

        <h2>Tetris</h2>
        <h3>Sega, Released June 6, 1984</h3>
        <p>
          In Tetris, players complete lines by moving differently shaped pieces
          (tetrominoes), which descend onto the playing field. The completed
          lines disappear and grant the player points, and the player can
          proceed to fill the vacated spaces. The game ends when the uncleared
          lines reach the top of the playing field. The longer the player can
          delay this outcome, the higher their score will be. In multiplayer
          games, players must last longer than their opponents; in certain
          versions, players can inflict penalties on opponents by completing a
          significant number of lines. Some versions add variations on the
          rules, such as three-dimensional displays or a system for reserving
          pieces. Built on simple rules, Tetris established itself as one of the
          greatest video games ever made. By December 2011, it had sold 202
          million copies approximately 70 million physical units and 132 million
          paid mobile game downloads making it one of the best-selling video
          game franchises. The Game Boy version is one of the best-selling games
          of all time, with more than 35 million copies sold. Tetris is
          available on over 65 platforms, setting a Guinness world record for
          the most ported video game. Tetris is rooted within popular culture
          and its popularity extends beyond the sphere of video games; imagery
          from the game has influenced architecture, music, and cosplay. Tetris
          is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different
          geometric forms, called "tetrominoes", descend from the top of the
          field. During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally
          and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a
          piece that had been placed before it. The player can neither slow down
          the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them, in most
          versions.
